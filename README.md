<h1>Hi, I'm Srujana Guggilla <br/>Data Engineer</a>

<h2> Welcome To My World 🌎🦋 </h2>

**Based:** Texas, Arlington

**Current Job**: Data Engineer 

**Email:** guggilla.srujana25@gmail.com


Hello, my name is Guggilla Srujana! I am a data addict with a solid background in Data Science and a love of numbers, statistics and data in general. With a master's degree in "Data Science" I bring to the field of data a unique blend of technical expertise and an analytical approach. As a candidate seeking the role of **Data Engineer**, I am delighted to demonstrate my technical, analytical and logical talents in the field of **Data Engineering** and **Data Science**.

**Why you should know me ⁉️**

While most people focus on presenting a formal resume to showcase their professional journey, I believe the story behind the scenes—the backstory of a person is just as important. Just like the ETL process in data engineering, where raw data is extracted, transformed, and loaded to uncover valuable insights, understanding someone's backstory helps connect the dots and reveals the "why" behind their journey.

So, if you're reading this, I hope you're intrigued to learn more about my experiences, my passions, and the connections that have shaped who I am today. After all, every story, just like every dataset, holds something valuable waiting to be discovered.

**What made me choose Data Science ❓**

During my time at university, I pursued Electronics and Communication Engineering, where I gained a strong foundation in working with IoT devices and applying data science concepts to extract meaningful insights from hardware-generated data. This combination of hardware knowledge and data analytics sparked my interest in exploring the world of Data Science. I began leveraging my technical skills to analyze, model, and visualize data, shifting my focus toward solving complex problems through data-driven solutions. This transition allowed me to merge my passion for technology with the dynamic field of Data Science, where I now thrive.

Now, I can effectively declare that I can work with complex data and proficient in constructing efficient data pipelines, developing expansive data lakes, and optimizing data warehouses using a blend of programming expertise and cloud technologies. Furthermore, while taking classes at university laboratories, I obtained expertise in **leadership**, **data management**, **statistical analysis**, **machine learning** and **data manipulation**, all of which I believe will be useful for my next adventure as a **Data Engineer**.

In my spare time, I am always excited investigate new data analysis / manipulation tools and approaches, always looking for ways to broaden my knowledge and sharpen my skills.
If you're seeking for someone with a unique combination of software development and data engineering skills, I'd love to talk about how I might help your projects and organization. Please contact me and let's begin on a data-driven journey together!

<h2> Work Experience 👩‍💻</h2>

**University of Texas at Arlington | Teaching Assistant |** 👩‍🏫💸

I have always been passionate about teaching, so I took up the teaching assistant position as an on-campus part-time role. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of teaching and learning alongside undergraduate students. Helping them master Python for data science, clearing their doubts, and ensuring they understood even the most challenging concepts gave me immense satisfaction. This role not only strengthened my technical expertise but also boosted my confidence in my leadership skills and ability to connect with others. It taught me how to communicate complex ideas effectively and adapt my approach based on the needs of different individuals. I believe this experience is a significant plus point as I step into a professional setting, where teamwork, mentorship, and understanding diverse perspectives are just as important as technical skills.

**University of Texas at Arlington | Data Engineer |** 👩‍💼💸

During my master’s, I worked on a research project with clinical trial data—my first venture into healthcare. Even with 2 years of data engineering experience in IT, this was a whole new challenge. I had to adapt quickly, applying my skills to a sensitive and complex field. Along the way, I learned how research works behind the scenes and gained valuable insights into healthcare data. It was a rewarding experience that helped me grow both technically and personally.

**Accenture, India | Data Engineer |** 👩‍💼💸

This was my first IT field experience and a step into the corporate world, where I learned how real-world projects work. I worked on a financial team as a data engineer, generating reports with Python libraries, migrating datasets to the cloud, and replacing legacy SSIS packages with Python scripts to improve efficiency. I also optimized ETL pipelines using cloud platforms and streamlined data workflows with Power BI Power Query. It was a great learning experience that sharpened my technical skills and gave me insight into the corporate environment.


<h2> Data Engineer Projects 👩‍💻📉💹 </h2>

**A Predictive Model Based on Real Estate Transactions**
In this project, I used models like ADA Boost, XG Boost, Random Forest, Ridge, and Lasso to predict house prices based on various features. To make the insights more accessible, I built an interactive Tableau dashboard for data visualization, allowing users to explore and understand the factors influencing house prices easily.
